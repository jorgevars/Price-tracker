# Price-tracker
Good day people.

This is a script to help track prices on certain pages.

I'm from Mexico so the pages are biased for my country.

If you'd like to help improve this little script, I'll thank you.

These are the pages which this script works
-www.amazon.com.mx
-www.amazon.com
-www.bestbuy.com.mx
-www.mercadolibre.com.mx

There is two CSV files. 

Price tracker.csv. You need to introduce your mail and password (if you use gmail, I recommend you to see [this](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB) tutorial.
ids.csv It is the file that stores all the ids, classes to lookup while scrapping with beautifulsoup.

Sorry for my english in advance :3

Best regards!!
