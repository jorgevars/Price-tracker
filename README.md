# Price-tracker
Good day people.

This is a script to help track prices on certain pages.

I'm from Mexico so the pages are biased for my country.

If you'd like to help improve this little script, I'll thank you.

These are the pages which this script works
-www.amazon.com.mx
-www.amazon.com
-www.bestbuy.com.mx
-www.mercadolibre.com.mx

Sorry for my english in advance

Best regards!!
